        <p> At its heart, <strong>HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements</strong>, <em>which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document</em> (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.

Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content).</p>
